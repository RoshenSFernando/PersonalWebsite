<p align = "justify" style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 18px"> I am an economist currently working at the World Bank as a consultant. As part of my work, I evaluate the economic impacts of climate risks and policies using economic models.

<p align = "justify" style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 18px"> Prior to joining the Bank, I obtained my PhD in Economics from the Crawford School of Public Policy of the Australian National University. Given my interest in integrated modeling of the socioeconomic impacts of complex challenges to humanity, for my PhD research, I evaluated the economic consequences of infectious diseases (such as COVID-19), climate change, and antimicrobial resistance.
